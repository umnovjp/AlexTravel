  <h3>Capital city of San Jose did not impress. Or may be I did not know where to look. Visited local market, some central streets</h3>
  <h4>Travel agency chanrges $YYY for a tour to Arenal volcano, Hanging Bridges national Park and La Fortuna waterfall. Volcano did not impress at all. It was not a climb, but just a walk to take pictures with volcano in the background. The only thing that impressed at waterfall was lizard that was able to swim. Hanging Bridges National park was really great. Adventure started with sloth taking pictures with me. 
    Then I saw a band of coatimudis who did not pay attention at me.Can you spot one with long tail? Then I saw famous red-backed poison frog. And then there was atiny snake. </h4>
