  <h3>Capital city of San Jose did not impress. Or may be I did not look in the right direction</h3>
  <h4>Travel agency chanrges $YYY for a tour to Arenal volcano, Hanging Bridges national Park and La Fortuna waterfall. Volcano impress at all. It was not a climb, but just a walk to take pictures with volcano in the background. The only thing that impressed at waterfall was lizard that was able to swim. Hanging Bridges National park was really great. Adventure started with sloth taking pictures with me.</h4>
